# Practical 1: Exporing Python Performance with Computational Fluid Dynamics

- Connect to Cirrus with X forwarding turned on (`ssh -XY`)
    - You are free to use a machine of your choosing other than Cirrus, however it will need the following:
        - a Python distribution (Python 2 or Python 3) that includes NumPy, SciPy, and Numba (e.g. the Anaconda distribution)
        - gcc and/or gfortran

- Clone this repository on Cirrus: `git clone https://github.com/EPCCed/APT-python4hpc.git`
- `module load anaconda gcc/8.2.0`
- Follow the practical instructions in the browser, starting with [README.ipynb](https://github.com/EPCCed/APT-python4hpc/blob/master/exercises/01-cfd/README.ipynb)
- To view `flow.png` files, use the `display` command
